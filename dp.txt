Here’s a revised and clear summary that incorporates the additional information for presenting the DataPool's role in SimpliFi:

In the SimpliFi project, our primary focus is building a cloud-based DataPool on Azure Synapse. This serves as the backbone for ingesting, processing, managing, and exposing data. Here’s an overview of the key components and steps involved:

    Data Ingestion & Staging: We onboard data from various source systems into the DataPool, storing it in ADLS Gen2 in a schema-validated and re-formatted Parquet file format. This acts as the foundation for further processing.

    Data Processing Pipeline:
        Raw Data Vault (RDV): Data from source systems is ingested as-is into the RDV, a flexible layer that preserves data integrity with deduplication and technical attributes like hashing.
        Business Data Vault (BDV): Data from the RDV is transformed into the BDV, a business-oriented harmonized layer, where global data harmonization occurs. This includes centralizing reference and master data, applying business rules, and ensuring a consistent view of data across SimpliFi.
        Consumption Layer (CL): Specific datasets, datamarts, and interfaces are prepared for business consumption in this layer. This includes applying transformations, aggregations, and preparing KPIs, dimensions, and facts. These datasets are then exposed for reporting in Power BI or other applications.

    Data Quality & Integrity: At every stage, data quality (DQ) and integrity checks are embedded to ensure accuracy and correctness before data is available for business use. This guarantees a reliable and high-quality dataset.

    Data Exposure: We provide flexible access to processed datasets, either in push or pull modes, to meet application requirements and feed reporting tools like Power BI.

    Automation & Governance: The platform automates deployments, migrations, and testing, while ensuring proper governance, security, and compliance. This includes managing access and permissions across the DataPool.

    Error Handling: Robust error handling is applied throughout the data pipeline to catch and resolve issues at each stage.
